  <h2>Machine learning이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><strong><a href = "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target = "_blank" title = "html5 specification">Machine learning(ML)</a></strong> is the study of computer algorithms that improve <u>automatically</u> through <strong>experience</strong>.
  [1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
  [2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>

  <p style = "margin-top:40px;">A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.</p>
