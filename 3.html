  <h2>Support-vector machine이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
  Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Vapnik et al., 1997), SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1974) and Vapnik (1982, 1995).

  <p style = "margin-top:40px;">In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.</p>
